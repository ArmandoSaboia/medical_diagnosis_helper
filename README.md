🤖 Meet the Diagnosis Wizard: Picture an AI buddy that listens to symptoms and suggests potential diagnoses. It's like having a medical detective right on your screen, thanks to Naive Bayes! 

🧬 The Secret Sauce: This wizard learned from heaps of examples to understand symptoms and diagnoses. When someone shares their symptoms, the wizard conjures up a prediction using Naive Bayes. Pretty magical, huh? 

💡 Illuminating Insights: Check out the awesome visualization! It shows how often the wizard guessed different possibilities. It's like a crystal ball aiding doctors to put together clues and provide top-notch care.
